# slyc-metabolic-model

This repository contains scripts to perform simulations on VYTOP (Virtual Young TOmato Plant).
The young tomato plant model is based on Sl2183, a cell metabolic model of tomato available in the repository.

The scripts developed require Python (preferably 3.5), CPLEX Python API developed by IBM (free for academics), and the python packages lxml and pandas.

fba.py: script for Flux Balance Analysis with the objective functions:
1.minimization of photon uptake
2.minimization of absolute fluxes (at minimal photon uptake)

fba_atp_cost_variation.py: impact of ATP transport cost on exchange fluxes

fba_reaction_inactivation.py: modeling ot mutant tomato strains (reaction flux inactivated or reduced)

fba_nh4_no3_ratio.py: impact of an nh4_no3 imposed ratio on tomato fluxes

fba_nitrogen_reduction.py: impact of limiting nitrogen uptake rate on tomato growth

fba_stem_efficiency.py: impact of altering stem ability to perform photosynthesis

fba_stem_proportion.py: impact of altering the percentage of stem in total tomato plant weight

fva.py: flux variability analysis, determining the min and max of each flux that still sustains the optimal solution found in fba

fva_sbc.py: flux variability analysis with all boundary import reactions set to 0 to unravel SBCs of the network

fva_sbc_MinFluxSum: same as fva_sbc.py, but this time the sum of fluxes is minimized to 0, to show that all SBCs disappear

fva.py: flux variability analysis, determining the min and max of each flux that still sustains the optimal solution found in fba

network_parser.py: generates the three compartment model (stoichiometry matrix, lists of reactions, metabolites, boundary metabolites) from the SBML file

input: contains the SBML file Sl2183 and all the input parameters to perform simulations in .csv files
the user can modify these files depending on his/her biological question

output: modeling results (flux values generated by the different scripts)
