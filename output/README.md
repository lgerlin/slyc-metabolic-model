# slyc-metabolic-model / output

This repository contains results of the simulations performed VYTOP (Virtual Young TOmato Plant).
The young tomato plant model is based on Sl2186, a cell metabolic model of tomato available in the repository.

The name of the files explicitates which simulation was performed.
Additionnal informations on the model calibration are also mentionned:
Xyl_1 means that xylem fluxes were constrainted while Xyl_0 means they were not
TransportCost_1.5 means that the ATP transport cost used is 1.5
RatioPS_7.7 means that the ratio of contribution to photosynthesis between leaf and stem is 7.7

The parser folder contains informations on the 3 compartment model generated.
