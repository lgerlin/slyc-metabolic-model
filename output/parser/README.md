# slyc-metabolic-model / output / parser

contains informations on the 3 compartment model generated

the txt files provide list of informations from VYTOP on
-the stoichiometry matrix (rows.txt, columns.txt, coefficients.txt, exchangestoichMat_columns, exchangestoichMat_rows.txt, exchangestoichMat_values.txt)
-the boundary metabolites (boundary.txt, boundary_metabolites.txt)
-the metabolic formulas (reactions_formulas.txt, reactions_formulasNames.txt, exchangereactions_formulas.txt, exchangereactions_formulasNames.txt)
-the IDs and names (reactions_id.txt, reactions_name.txt, metabolites_id.txt)
-the reversibility (reactions_reversible.txt)

it also provides basic informations of the cell metabolic model (one compartment): metab_id_1comp.txt, react_id_1comp.txt
